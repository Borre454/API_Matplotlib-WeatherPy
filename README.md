# HW_6_WeatherPy

## Created a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. Utilized citipy Python library and OpenWeatherMap API to accomplish this.

- Built a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:
  - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
  - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
  - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
  - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
